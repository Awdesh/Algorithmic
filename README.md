HashTable Vs HashMap-:

1.) HashTable is synchronized which means multiple threads can access a single hash table whereas HashMap is not which is why HashMap is more suitable for non-threaded applications. Non-synchronized tends to perform better and faster.

2.) Hashtable does not allow null keys or values.  HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values.
